**Contact:** support@plotability.net
We respect your privacy. This policy describes how we handle personal information in accordance with the **Privacy Act 1988 (** **Cth** **)** and the **Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)** . Where we handle EU/UK data, see the **International** **transfers** section.
**1. Personal information we collect**
- **Account &** **contact** : name, email, region/time zone, support communications.
- **Billing** : via Stripe—payment method details are handled by Stripe; we store limited transactional metadata (amount, status, last 4 digits, expiry month/year).
- **App usage & device** : logs (IP address, device type, OS/browser), event timestamps, error diagnostics.
- **Content** : the project data you add (cards, notes, attachments). This is typically not “personal information” unless you include personal details.
- **API keys (BYOK)** : if you store an external AI key in the app, we store it encrypted locally (and/or in your chosen secure storage) and transmit only as necessary to fulfil your requests.
**2. How we use personal information**
- Provide, operate, and improve the Service.
- Authenticate and secure accounts; prevent fraud/abuse.
- Process payments and manage subscriptions.
- Provide support and service communications.
- Comply with legal obligations and respond to lawful requests.
**3. Legal bases (APPs & consent)**
We collect personal information with your consent and where reasonably necessary for our functions/activities (APP 3). You may decline to provide certain data, but some features may not work.
**4. Disclosure to third parties**
We may disclose limited personal information to:
- **Stripe** (payments), **cloud/hosting** and analytics providers, email/support tools.
- Professional advisers and insurers (confidentiality-bound).
- Authorities as required by law or to protect rights, safety, or security.
We do not sell personal information.
**5. International transfers**
Our service providers may be located outside Australia (e.g., the US, EU, or other regions). Where we disclose personal information overseas, we take reasonable steps to ensure recipients protect it in line with the APPs (APP 8). If you use BYOK with a non-AU provider, your prompts/outputs may be processed where that provider operates—review their privacy terms.
**6. Data security**
We use technical and organisational measures (encryption in transit, role-based access, least-privilege, audit logging) and expect our vendors to do the same. No method is 100% secure; report suspected incidents to **support@plotability.net** .
**7. Data retention**
- **Account & billing** : retained while your account is active and for reasonable periods for legal/accounting purposes.
- **Content** : retained while your account is active or until you delete/export it.
- **Backups/** **logs** : kept for limited durations for reliability and security.
**8. Access & correction (APP 12 & 13)**
