**Refunds & Cancellations (Australia)**
**Effective date:** [Effective Date] 
**Business name:** Plotability — The Jeffrey Trust (ABN [ABN]) 
**Contact:** support@plotability.net
This policy explains how refunds for **one-time purchases** of Plotability are handled under Australian law. There are **no subscriptions, renewals, tokens, or credits** at this stage.
**1) Cancellations**
- Plotability is sold as a **single upfront purchase** .
- There is **no ongoing subscription to cancel** . After purchase, you can stop using the app at any time.
**2) Change of mind**
- Because access to a digital product is delivered immediately, we generally **don’t offer refunds for change of mind** .
- This does **not** limit your rights under the **Australian Consumer Law (ACL)** .
**3) Your ACL rights**
Your consumer guarantees under the **ACL** apply in addition to this policy.
- **Major failure:** If Plotability has a problem that would have stopped a reasonable consumer from buying it, is substantially unfit for its common purpose and can’t be fixed within a reasonable time, or is unsafe, you are entitled to a **refund** or other remedy permitted by law.
- **Minor failure:** We will remedy the issue within a reasonable time—typically by supplying an update, fix, or workaround. If we don’t, you may seek a refund.
**4) Defects & technical issues we’ll act on**
Examples include (but aren’t limited to):
- You cannot activate or access the purchased app due to an issue attributable to us (not your device, OS, connectivity, or third-party limits).
- The product materially fails to perform the core functions described on our site, and we cannot fix it within a reasonable time.
- The product description materially misrepresented capabilities at the time of purchase.
*Note:* Some optional features depend on **your external AI provider** via BYOK (Bring Your Own API key). Outages, costs, or policy changes by your chosen provider are outside our control and are not faults of Plotability itself.
**5) Billing errors**
If you believe you were charged incorrectly, contact us within **30 days** of purchase. We’ll investigate and, where appropriate, arrange a **correction or refund** to the original payment method.
**6) Trials, promos & upgrades**
- If we offer a **trial** or **demo** , please use it to evaluate fit before purchasing.
- **Promotional pricing** applies only for the stated offer period.
- If we release **optional paid upgrades** in the future, purchasing them will be separate from your original one-time licence.
**7) How to request help or a refund**
Email **support@plotability.net** with:
- your account email,
- purchase date and amount (Stripe receipt if available),
- a clear description of the issue and what you’ve tried (screenshots/logs help).
We aim to respond within **2 business days** and will work with you to diagnose or resolve the problem. If a refund is due under the ACL or this policy, we’ll confirm approval in writing.
**8) Processing refunds**
Approved refunds are processed to the **original payment method via Stripe** . Bank processing times vary by institution. We’ll notify you once the refund has been initiated.
**9) Fair use & abuse**
We may decline a refund where there is evidence of **misuse, fraud, or extensive use** inconsistent with the claimed issue. This does not limit your ACL rights.
**10) Changes to this policy**
We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will be posted on our website with the **Effective** **date** above .
